       Body Image

        <p2>
          In a world where the media has a specific image that is characterized as "beautiful" for women, it can be difficult for women to adjust to the changes their bodies undergo.
          According to a survery done by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, 77% of women of women 50 and younger were unhappy with their body image.
          As the physical change which women go through can be difficult in an unexplicable way, it is important that people support any family members and friends who have cancer.
          Remind them that they are, and always will be, beautiful!
