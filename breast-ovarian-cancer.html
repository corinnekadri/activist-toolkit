       Financial Impact
     </h3>
        <p2>
          According to breastcancer.org, even 12 years after being diagnosed, women who were treated for breast cancer had to spend between $1,000 to $3,000 annually.

          It is not uncommon for many women to dip into their retirement savings in order to make ends meet with such debts.

       What should change?
     </h3>
        <p2>
          Many say that products such as pads and tampons should be covered in basic healthcare plans for women. 
          After all, many other kinds of expensive medications are fully or partially covered by certain healthcare plans.
          This leaves no doubt that such measures can be taken to support women and provide sanitary and menstrual needs.
          In the meantime, a great affordable and environmetally-friendly alternative is the menstrual cup, which works similarly to a tampon; 
          it is a silicon cup which can be reused once thoroughly cleaned.
