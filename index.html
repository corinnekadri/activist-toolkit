          Women face many obstacles when it comes to inequality, including a
          lack of power over their own body and physical health.

        What is the issue?

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

        The resources for women’s health are not nearly as accessible and
        accepted as they should be. Feminine products are taxed in most states
        making taking care of your body a financial burden. The decision on what
        women chose to do with their own body is restricted by other people.
        Having a period is often viewed with scrutiny and shame.

        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

        Women make up almost half of the global population and having your
        period comes with being a woman. If 1 out of 2 people have their period,
        why is there so much stigma around it and a lack of resources? The
        stigma and shame that surrounds menstruation can lead to girls not
        asking for help.

        What is the "Pink Tax"?
      </h2>

      <p>
        When it comes to gender specific items, women’s products tend to cost
        more. The difference in prices based solely on the “gender” of the
        product is the “pink tax”. Girls’ clothing costs 4% more than boys and
        women’s clothing costs 8% more than men. Girls’ toys cost 7% more than
        boys’. Women’s hygiene products cost 13% more than men’s.

      <p>
        About 13% of women are diagnosed with breast cancer, and about 2.5% of
        women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Cancer is an extremely
        expensive disease to treat. Many women and their families struggle
        financially because of this. In addition, it can take a major toll on
        women’s mental health in relation to their mental body image.
