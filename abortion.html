        Abortion and Birth Control

      <p1>
        Laws and regulations often deny women control of their body and the
        ability to make their own decisions. For that reason, women are often
        denied of proper reproductive health resources, such as abortion and
        birth control.

          Women should be able to have the choice of having an abortion without having to justify their decision. 
          However, there are several unjust laws in place in certain states which deny women this option.
          Without the option to recieve abortions, many women will either resort to unsafe ways of performing an abortion on their own without a professional.
          Other women will have no choice but to continue with the pregnancy and give birth.
          Unfortunately, some women conceive through rape, and will go through an unwanted pregnancy and childbirth.
          For some women, continuing with their pregnancy can lead to health related risks. 
          Some women are much younger, and not ready for such a drastic change in their lives.
          Regardless, a woman's reason for abortion is only her business, and only her choice.

       Birth Control
     </h3>
        <p2>
          Birth control comes in many forms. 
          For women, the most common kind is the oral pill form. 
          This pill is essentially a hormonal supplement that, when taken regularly, prevent contraception.
          The pill also regulates the menstrual cycle, and can help lessen menstrual cramps and hormonal acne.
          This form of birth control is a prescribed medication, and is often very expensive. 
          Many women in the U.S. struggle to obtain birth control because they either do not have healthcare, or because their healthcare plan does not cover the cost.
          It can become especially difficult for women who have neither the choice of using birth control, nor having an abortion.

          It is completely unjust that many women do not have proper access to proper reproductive health services.
          For far too long, men have not only dominated in the government, but they have also largely dictated the regulations surrounding abortion and birth control.
          Men should not be in charge of the products and services which women have access to, especially considering that their reproductive health is completely different than that of women.
          A woman's body is hers, and hers only.

         If 1 out of 2 people have their period, why is there so much stigma around it and a lack of resources?
