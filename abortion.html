        Abortion and Birth Control
      </h2>
      <p1>
        Laws and regulations often deny women control of their body and the
        ability to make their own decisions. For that reason, women are often
        denied of proper reproductive health resources, such as abortion and
        birth control.

     <h3>
       Why are there taxes?
     </h3>
        <p2>
          There are taxes in many states on menstrual products such as pads and tampons, as if they are unessential products. 
          However, these products are vital for women to live a healthy and comfortable lifestyle, and are thus, completely essential.

       The Pink Tax
     </h3>
        <p2>
          "The Pink Tax" is when products have what is known as "gender-based pricing".
          In this situation, women end up paying more for the same product that men can buy for a cheaper price.
          These products are almost always of the same quality, but are simply marketed differently for women, often by making the product pink and more feminine-looking.

       <h3>
       What should change?
     </h3>
        <p2>
          Many say that products such as pads and tampons should be covered in basic healthcare plans for women. 
          After all, many other kinds of expensive medications are fully or partially covered by certain healthcare plans.
          This leaves no doubt that such measures can be taken to support women and provide sanitary and menstrual needs.
          In the meantime, a great affordable and environmetally-friendly alternative is the menstrual cup, which works similarly to a tampon; 
          it is a silicon cup which can be reused once thoroughly cleaned.
